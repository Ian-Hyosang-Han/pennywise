## PennyWise
PennyWise is an ongoing personal project designed to help users track their daily expenses efficiently and visually. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, the app allows users to add, view, and delete expenses with a clean and responsive UI. It features monthly filtering, categorized spending summaries with icon-based visualizations, and dynamic graph animations.

Key technologies and tools used:

🧠 React & TypeScript: Component-based architecture with strong type safety.

🎨 Tailwind CSS: Utility-first styling for fast and scalable UI development.

🔄 React Query (@tanstack/react-query): For fetching, caching, and synchronizing expense data.

📦 json-server: Used as a mock backend to simulate API operations (CRUD).

📊 Custom bar graph: Visual summary of monthly expenses by category.

📁 Organized component structure with reusable hooks and modular styling.

This project reflects my focus on user experience, frontend architecture, and practical use of modern React ecosystem tools.
